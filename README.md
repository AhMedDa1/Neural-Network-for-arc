This repository contains the implementation for the Master's thesis:

"A Context-Aware Neural Network for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)"

This project introduces a novel two-stage neural architecture designed to solve abstract reasoning tasks from the ARC dataset. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on hand-crafted rules or program synthesis, this work explores whether a purely neural system can implicitly learn reasoning patterns from a few examples.

ðŸ§  Architecture

The model consists of two sequential components:

    Vision Transformer
    Analyzes input/output demonstration grids to infer a puzzleâ€™s logic and compress it into a context vector.

    U-Net Decoder
    Conditioned on the context vector using cross-attention, this module applies the inferred logic to transform a new, unseen input grid.

    A new model is trained from scratch for each puzzle, ensuring it learns the logic uniquely from the provided demonstrations.

ðŸš€ Usage

    Select Puzzles
    Modify the PUZZLE_ID list in main.py to specify which puzzles to run.

    Run the Model

    python main.py

    Output

        Visualizations will be saved in the visualizations/ folder.

        Metrics will be stored in results.json.
